@brief
Program takes in a JointState message from a dataglove on a ROS topic '/master_hand/joint_angles'.
It assumes that the master hand is human. Asks the human user for calibration poses to determine
delta values in T and calculates delta values of robot hand based on joint maxima and minima.
Maps from human joint values to teleoperation subspace (T) and then from T to the slave hand's joint
values. Slave joint values are published on a ROS topic called '/slave_hand/command' (JointState
message).

Notation:
o - origin
A = projection matrix
delta = scaling factor
T = teleoperation subspace
