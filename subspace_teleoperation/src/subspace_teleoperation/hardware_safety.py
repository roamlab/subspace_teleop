@brief
Contains a hardwares safety class which performs very limited safety checks to
help protect hardware. We HIGHLY recommend adding more safety functions based
on your specific hardware and teleoepration needs.

    '''Hardware safety class, which performs safety checks for the slave hand. We 
    only check that the slave joint angles computed are within the range of  
    maximum and minimum joint angles, which are provided by the teleoperation
    function. This class should have a member function called ensure_robot_safety. 
    Within that function, you can call whatever safety checks you have created 
    for the slave robot. We have only provided a safety check which ensures that
    the slave joint angles are within a given range.'''
