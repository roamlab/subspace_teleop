###########################################
TO CREATE AN XML FILE FOR A NEW ROBOT HAND:
###########################################

The xml file should start with a hand tag with Name and Dimension
descriptions which define the robot name and number of joints (N).

The xml file will also include tags called Joint_Names, Joint_Minima,
Joint_Maxima and Origin. The joint names, joint maxima, joint minima 
and origin tags should all have the same number of attributes for 
DimVals as the number of Dimensions you defined above.

The Joint_Names tag will have the DimVals (d0,d1,...,dN) set to 
strings which are the joint names. For the slave hand, these joint 
names will be used in the published JointState command message.

The Joint_Maxima and Joint_Minima tags should have the DimVals 
(d0,d1,...,dN) set to the maximum and minimum value that each joint 
(0,1,...N) can move to.

The Origin tag will have the DimVals (d0,d1,...,dN) set to the value
of the neutral origin pose. An illustration and description of the 
neutral origin pose used in the example hand_models can be found in 
Section III.A.1 of "Intuitive Hand Teleoperation by Novice Operators 
Using a Continuous Teleoperation Subspace" (Meeker, et al. 2018).

Depending on your robot, the values for the joint maxima, joint 
minima and the origin will either be in degrees or radians. If the 
DimVals in the XML file of the slave hand are in degrees, the 
command published by the subspace mapping will also be in degrees. 
The same goes for radians.

The XML file will also have Spread_Dimension, Size_Dimension, and 
Curl_Dimension tags.

To fill in the DimVals for the spread, size and curl dimension tags, 
follow the steps found in Section III.A.2 of "Intuitive Hand 
Teleoperation by Novice Operators Using a Continuous Teleoperation 
Subspace" (Meeker, et al. 2018) to find the values of psi which make 
up the projection matrix A. The DimVals in the Spread_Dimension tag 
will have as many attributes as there are non-zero values in psi_alpha. 
If psi_alpha has non-zero values at indices 0, 4, and 7, then the 
Spread_Dimension tag will have DimVals with attributes called d0, d4 
and d7. The rules for the Size and Curl Dimensions are the same.

Some of the example models also have a range tag within the spread, 
size and curl dimensions, but this is not loaded in this iteration 
of the load_file functions. It can be used to preset delta, but we 
have a function to calculate delta based on min/max joint angles, 
so the range tag is not necessary.

See below for illustrative examples.  The meshes/images of these hands
can be found in Graspit!.


EXAMPLE 1: THE SCHUNK SDH HAND
Order of joints: adduction, f1_prox, f1_dist, fixed_prox, fixed_dist, f2_prox, f2_dist

For this hand, joints which affect the size of the object we can 
grasp are f1 prox, fixed prox, f2 prox. Joints which affect the 
curl of the fingers are f1 dist, fixed dist, f2 dist. The joint 
which affects the spread/adduction of the fingers is the adduction 
joint.

So we create the un-normalized versions of psi:
	psi_alpha = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  --> spread
	psi_sigma = [0, 1, 0 1, 0, 1, 0]  --> size
	psi_epsilon = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  --> curl

We normalize the psis:
	psi_alpha = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  --> spread
	psi_sigma = [0, 0.577, 0 0.577, 0, 0.577, 0]  --> size
	psi_epsilon = [0, 0, 0.577, 0, 0.577, 0, 0.577]  --> curl

We convert these into the XML tags:
	<Spread_Dimension>
		<DimVals d0="-1" ></DimVals>
	</Spread_Dimension>

	<Size_Dimension>
		<DimVals d1="0.57735" d3="0.57735" d5="0.57735" ></DimVals>
	</Size_Dimension>

	<Curl_Dimension>
		<DimVals d2="0.57735" d4="0.57735" d6="0.57735" ></DimVals>
	</Curl_Dimension>

You will note that the spread dimension is negated. Occasionally 
because of the direction in which the fingers open or are spread, 
values in the psis will need to be negated. This is usually only 
necessary for the spread dimension. If you find your robot fingers 
spreading in the wrong direction (abducting when they should be 
adducting), try negating one or more values in the spread dimension.



EXAMPLE 2: THE VELO GRIPPER
Order of joints: F1 proximal,  F1 distal, F2 proximal, F2 distal

For this hand, joints which affect the size of the object we can 
grasp are F1 proximal and F2 proximal (indices 0, 2).  Joints which 
affect how curled the fingers are are F1 distal and F2 distal 
(indices 1, 3). There are no joints which will spread/adduct the 
fingers.

So we create the un-normalized versions of psi:
	psi_alpha = [0, 0, 0, 0]  --> spread
	psi_sigma = [1, 0, 1, 0]  --> size
	psi_epsilon = [0, 1, 0, 1]  --> curl

We normalize the psis:
	psi_alpha = [0, 0, 0, 0]  --> spread
	psi_sigma = [0.707106, 0, 0.707106, 0]  --> size
	psi_epsilon = [0, 0.707106, 0, 0.707106]  --> curl

We convert these into the XML tags:
	<Spread_Dimension>
		<DimVals></DimVals>
	</Spread_Dimension>

	<Size_Dimension>
		<DimVals d0="0.707106" d2="0.707106"></DimVals>
	</Size_Dimension>

	<Curl_Dimension>
		<DimVals d1="0.707106" d3="0.707106" ></DimVals>
	</Curl_Dimension>

Because the psi for the spread dimension has no non-zero values, this
tag can be left empty. The non-zero values for psi_sigma and psi_epsilon
are added to the DimVals for their respective dimensions where the 
attribute is named "d"+"non-zero index".


################################################################
HOW XML FILES ARE TRANSLATED TO PROJECTION MATRICES DESCRIBED IN
"Intuitive Hand Teleoperation by Novice Operators Using a 
Continuous Teleoperation Subspace" (Meeker, et al. 2018):
################################################################

load_from_file.py performs all operations related to reading in 
the hand information from the xml files. Below is a brief summary 
on how the information is read in and converted to matrices.

The xml file which is read in is found using the model_dir and the 
hand_name given in the launch file. Using xml.etree.ElementTree, 
the xml file is parsed. If a tag is missing in the xml file, the
function will return None for that tag. 

The hand name and dimensions are read in as a string and int variable,
respectively. The origin values, joint minima and joint maxima are 
read in as float arrays. For example, from the schunk.xml file in the 
hand_models folder:

XML:
<Origin>
	<DimVals d0="0" d1="5" d2="0" d3="5" d4="0" d5="5" d6="0"/>
</Origin>

Loaded into python as:
origin = [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]


The projection matrix A is initialized as an array of zeros with shape
of [num_dof, 3]. Then the spread, size and curl dimension tags are used
to fill in the non-zero values of the matrix. For example, from the 
schunk.xml file in the hand_models folder:

XML:
<Spread_Dimension>
	<DimVals d0="-1"/>
</Spread_Dimension>
<Size_Dimension>
	<DimVals d1="0.57735" d3="0.57735" d5="0.57735"/>
</Size_Dimension>
<Curl_Dimension>
	<DimVals d2="0.57735" d4="0.57735" d6="0.57735"/>
</Curl_Dimension>

Loaded into python as:
A = [[-1, 0,     0    ],
     [0,  0.577, 0    ], 
     [0,  0,     0.577],
     [0,  0.577, 0    ],
     [0,  0,     0.577],
     [0,  0.577, 0    ],
     [0,  0,     0.577]]

The dimension tag determines which column the non-zero numbers are placed
into (spread = column 0, size = column 1, curl = column 2). The DimVals
determine which row the non-zero numbers are assigned. A value assigned 
to d0 will be placed in row 0, etc.
